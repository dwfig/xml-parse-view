# xml-parse-view

Xml-parse-view (hosted at https://dwfig.github.io/xml-parse-view/) allows a generic XML file to be uploaded, parsed to JSON, and parsed back into XML. It also displays the XML in a human-readable format, attempting to conform it to a relatively standard spreadsheet view. If nodes are deeply-nested in a single branch, the full text for the whole branch may be displayed in one cell.
